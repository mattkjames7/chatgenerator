# Chat Generator Chats

This dataset contains a bunch of conversations generated using Llama3.2:3b. Each
conversation is seeded with a topic (a randomly chosen title of an English 
wikipedia page), then agents take it in turn conversing about the subject.

A small effort has been made to remove junk, but I'm sure there's still plenty
in there.

The code for generating these conversations can be found here:
